## ping.js (RECOMMENDED)

## tb-favicon.js (RECOMMENDED)

changes the favicon on the standalone trollbox page to the actual trollbox icon, also changes favicon when there's an unread message

## soundboard.js (RECOMMENDED)

adds a new command: /play `url`, that lets you play a sound that's less than 15 seconds to everyone else using the addon, also adds /mute `home` and /unmute `home` (SAVE!) which un/mutes the sounds someone sends making them not play sound, without having to block the person
